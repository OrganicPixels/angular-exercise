This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

To view the project please navigate to the project directory in terminal and run `npm install`.

Once all of the dependencies have ran, type `npm start` in the terminal to view the project.

The app should automatically open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5200/`

If you would like to avoid all that. You can open the dist folder and and just open the index.html file.   

Also, I've made a compiled version available on codepen if you'd just like to see it in action.  You can view that here.
